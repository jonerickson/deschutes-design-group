Hello,

We’d like to inform you that PERSCOM for Invision Community is approaching its end. With the recent announcement about the closure of the Invision Community Marketplace and the introduction of our standalone product, [PERSCOM](https://perscom.io), this transition is a natural step forward. The end-of-life date for PERSCOM for Invision Community is set for October 2023. While there won’t be any further active feature development for this product, please rest assured that you can continue to use it indefinitely, as Invision Community will still support external application uploads.

In light of this, it’s worth noting that with the upcoming release of Invision Community 5, it’s likely that the PERSCOM application won’t be compatible with the new version.

But here’s some exciting news! Our standalone product, [PERSCOM](https://perscom.io), is thriving and reshaping how personnel management is done. Unlike software built on third-party platforms that can suddenly become obsolete, [PERSCOM](https://perscom.io) is our proprietary software that’s here for the long haul. We’ve designed it to seamlessly integrate with other websites and applications you use, allowing you to showcase and share your PERSCOM data using our widgets. Whether you plan to stick with Invision Community or explore alternatives like WordPress or Squarespace, rest assured that [PERSCOM](https://perscom.io) will seamlessly fit in.

Over the next few months, we’ll be working on a converter that lets you migrate your PERSCOM data from Invision Community to your [PERSCOM](https://perscom.io) dashboard if you choose to do so. This service will be provided at no cost.

We understand that this news might come as a surprise, and we’re here to address any questions you may have. Feel free to reach out to us.
