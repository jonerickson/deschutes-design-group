We are excited to announce that we have been actively working on a new fresh coat of paint for PERSCOM.io.

<Image src={perscomImage} alt='PERSCOM UI update' />

We are talking from the ground up, completely re-written, all new UI â€“ allowing for better navigation, user experience, and setting the stage for future feature developments. With this refresh, we have paused all feature development until we roll out the new design. We will still continue to address bugs and errors, but all feature requests will be pushed to this new version. We know you are going to enjoy this! Stay tuned and enjoy these preview images.
